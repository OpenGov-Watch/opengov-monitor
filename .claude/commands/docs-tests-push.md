- update docs/ and docs/spec if you haven't done so yet. docs should be as terse as possible. you are documenting for experts and only need to document the specialties of this project, not explain anything.
- update the unit tests
- make sure you considered updates to the DOCKERFILE and any potential migrations
- run the tests. only fix issues related to the features you built. if you encounter other issues, STOP and tell the user what's going on
- do a `git diff` and check the files to commit
- update `.gitignore` if neccessary
- do `git add`. Add only files that relate to your changes
- `git commit` and `git push`
- NEVER do `git reset`, instead ask the user for help/clarification
- if you are pushing to the `production` branch, follow up with the /check-github-action-runs command
