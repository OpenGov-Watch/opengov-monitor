- Docs are directed at an expert audience.
  - Don't explain basic concepts,
  - don't explain what can be looked up in the code
  - Rather, show how it works and how it connects.
- avoid text duplication between docs files, README, and CLAUDE.md
- CLAUDE.md is intended to give the agent just enough context to navigate the repo and find enough info
- use subfolder CLAUDE.md files to give additional context for how to use and navigate the folder
- use README.md when the info is intended for everyone



spec/ is only for specification, not documentation
