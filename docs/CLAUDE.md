- `/docs` are directed at an expert audience.
  - Don't explain basic concepts,
  - don't explain what can be looked up in the code
  - Rather, show how it works and how it connects.
  - Do not describe "recent changes", just describe the current state.
- `docs/spec/` is only for specification, not documentation
- Howtos should go to `docs/howto/`
- `CLAUDE.md` files
  - MUST give agents just enough context to navigate the repo and find enough relevant context
  - shall be terse to preserve context
- `README.md`
  - when the info is intended for everyone
- Important: avoid text duplication between docs files, README, and CLAUDE.md
